# React TypeScript Tailwind Template

This is a template for creating a modern web application using **React**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Vite**. I created this template to quickly bootstrap my projects without having to set up the configuration from scratch.

## Features

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool that provides a smooth development experience.
